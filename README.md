# PathfindingAlgorithms
A test project made so I could try program the Dijkstra algorithm and A* algorithm. Feel free to use it if you want.

The program uses a function "runAlgorithm" to simulate both Dijkstra and A*. The parameter determines whether the program uses A* or not.

If you want to change the starting point or end point of the AI, find and change the respective char values close to the top of the main.cpp file. To know where the points are, consult the .png file which displays the entire map with the coordinates of each point (note that the coordinates were decided by eye, and the points were not drawn to a grid map).
