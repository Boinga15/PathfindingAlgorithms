# PathfindingAlgorithms
A test project made so I could try program the Dijkstra algorithm and A* algorithm. Feel free to use it if you want.

The program uses a function "runAlgorithm" to simulate both Dijkstra and A*. The parameter determines whether the program uses A* or not.

If you want to change the starting point or end point of the AI, find and change the respective char values close to the top of the main.cpp file.
